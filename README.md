<h1>QR Code Scanner App</h1>

<p>This app is a demo on how data flow from one point to another. 
This app scans QR codes generated by an expressJS application which are displayed on a frontend webpage (repo: https://github.com/KhaledELKarazle97/QRGenerator-Frontend).
Then displays the QR parameters in the URL of the QR code. After the data is displayed it is then saved to a MongoDB database
